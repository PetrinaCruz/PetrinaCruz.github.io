<p><span style=font-size:1.5em; color=brown>A</span>s the pandemic rolled into it's second year and the realization that COVID was probably here to stay in one form or another started sinking in, I made the decision to embrace the new "normal" and stop waiting for the return of the pre-COVID 19 world. That meant accepting that remote work/school was here to stay for the forseeable future and while I am currently helping to care for an ill parent, I would need to continue to distance myself from large gatherings to help avoid getting infected. In a pre-pandemic world I loved to travel and visit new places, but now my pleasures needed to be simpler and closer to home. I live in a great San Francisco neighborhood with lots to see and do. There's a recreation space where they host outside activities like yoga or a mobile gym. Some nights and weekends bands play for spectators who set up blankets on the green. And although it has been tough, many restaurants and cafes have managed to weather the storm that is COVID-19 and keep their doors open to serve the hungry public.   </p>
