<p>Hi! I'm Petrina. I was born and raised in San Francisco. In fact, I am a second generation San Franciscan. My interests include traveling, shopping, reading and meeting new people. Over the past several years I have been lucky enough to have been able to combine all four of those interests. I have lived in China, and traveled for extended time in Southeast Asia/India, the UK, the EU and Japan. The thing that I love the most about traveling is getting to meeting new people and learning about cultures and traditions that are different from my own. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 Pandemic has put most of my travels on hold, but I hope to be able to travel again soon.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 Pandemic has impacted people in many different ways. For me it became a time to start evaluate how I wanted to shape my career moving forward. In my previous job I had been allowed to make small adjustments to the website, but these were limited to changing a date, a name or an email address. Anything else had to go through our web developers. But this small glimpse into their world got me interested in web development as a career option. So now I am in my second semester in the CCSF program. Learning more about websites has changed the way that I view them. One of my favorite websites is the <a href="https://www.teeturtle.com/" target ="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TeeTurtle</a> shopping site. TeeTurtle started as a small company that sold cute and original t-shirts almost 10 years ago. Over the years they have expanded their offerings to include toys, games, stickers, pins and more. I started following them fairly early on and I have been watching how their website has continued to develop. They are constantly upgrading the home page and it has become increasingly interactive and informative. However, the actual shopping experience once you move past the home page hasn't actually changed that much over the past several years. And it can actually be a frustrating experience. For example, once you click on an item that you are interested in, the only way to move from that page is to use the back button on the browser toolbar. This wouldn't be too bad, except for the fact that it doesn't take you back to the place that you left off. Before I was just frustrated by this, now I look for these types of glitches in the user experience and hope to learn how to improve them.</p>

<h3>Here are some websites that I have found helpful in my Web Development Adventure so far:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">W3Schools</a> is my top pick for a one-stop shop for coding reference naterials. The site offers both free and paid premium resources.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">Codecademy</a> was one of the first on-line training sites that was recommended to me when I started telling people that I was interested in learning more about coding. Along with their self paced tutorials, they offer reference materials called &#34;Cheatsheets&#34; which provide quick answers with code snippet. 
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">MDN Web Docs</a> refers to itself as a &#34;Resource for developers, by developers.&#34; Because of that, it dives pretty deep into the subject matter which can be a little intimidating for a beginner. The higher level references are pretty solid, so you just have keep aware of how deep you want to dive into the information.</li>
  <li><a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">HTML Color Codes</a> is my go-to color palate when I want to make a quick selection. After that I can fine tune the colors to match the atmosphere that I am trying to convey.</li>
