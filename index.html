<h3>Mostly indoors:</h3> 
<p>As the number of Covid-19 cases begin to rise again with the Delta variant, many people are once again spending more time indoors. And as the temperatures start to dip, staying inside doesn't seem quite as bad as it did in the Summer. Here are some great shoe options if you'll be spending most of your time indoors this Fall.</p> 
<p>Since you don't have to worry much about shoes that need to hold up to inclimate weather focus on insulating materials that will keep your feet warm. Consider a warm fur-lined suede bootie like a classic pair of Ugg Bailey's with button or bow closures. Another great option would be a pair of Allbirds Wool Runners. Either pair is great for wearing indoors or on a quick run to Trader Joe's in the chilly weather.<br></p>

<h3>Mostly outdoors:</h3>
<p>If you are going to be spending most of your time outdoors this Fall you'll need shoes that are both warm and weather-proof. Many of us think of boots as the perfect foot gear to get us through the cold, rainy and snowy weather. While boots are a great, they aren't always the best option, so these are a few non-boot options to consider.</p>
<p>If you're a runner or outdoor adventure, the Nike Pegasus Trail 2 Gore-Tex Waterproof Trail Running Shoe is a stylish shoe that will help keep you feet nice and dry in rainy weather. If you need a more professional option for work, the Italeau Mara Ballet Flat is a super chic option that will hold up in the rain and comes in a wide range of colors. Not quite a boot, booties are a great option in the Fall and the Cole Haan Winnie Grand Waterproof Bootie would be make a great addition to anyone's Fall wardrobe.</p><br>
